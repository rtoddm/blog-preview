## Overview

This is a simple HTML and CSS project that I did to simply warm up and hone those basic skills which can get rusty quickly if you don't use them frequently.

## My process

My process on this project was pretty simple. I structured my HTML with a Mobile first workflow in mind and then added my CSS to get the right look. The last piece I added with the hover state for the h2 tag.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

In this project I began using rem and vh in my CSS. This helped to make this project more responsive. In my next project I plan on using CSS custom properties and Normalize.css.
